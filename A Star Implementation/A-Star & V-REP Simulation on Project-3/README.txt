Steps for Execution of Project 3

***PART-2***

Instructions for running the code-

1.	Extract the folder ‘Planning_Project2_Dipam’ to any of your folders.

2.	‘Planning_Project2_Dipam’ contains the following files

	I. A-Star & V-REP Simulation on Project-3

	a)	FinalCode.m
	b)	MoveLeft.m
	c)	MoveDown.m
	d)	MoveRight.m
	e)	MoveUp.m
	f)	MoveDownLeft.m
	g)	MoveDownRight.m
	h)	MoveUpRight.m
	i)	MoveUpLeft.m
	j)	HalfPlane.m
	k)	IDPoint
	l)	remApi.m
	m)	remoteApi.m
	n)	remoteApiProto.m
	o)	simpleTest.m
	p)	rrl_ideal.ttt


i.	Open the ‘rrl_ideal.ttt’ file which will run in V-REP Software.

ii.	Now, play the Simulation first in V-REP and then run the code named FinalCode.m from MATLAB.

iii.	When the FinalCode.m script is executed, it will ask to Input the Goal Point co-ordinates.

iv.	Once the program starts executing, it plots the A* in the workspace, i.e. the optimal path from the Start to End Point in MATLAB.

v.	Once the path is plotted, the TurtleBot2 in V-REP would start following the same path as depicted in MATLAB and reach the Goal Point.
