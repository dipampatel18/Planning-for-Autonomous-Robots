Steps for Execution of Project 3

***PART-1***

Instructions for running the code-

1.	Extract the folder ‘Planning_Project2_Dipam’ to any of your folders.

2.	‘Planning_Project2_Dipam’ contains the following files

	I. A-Star on Project-2

	a)	MainCode.m
	b)	MoveLeft.m
	c)	MoveDown.m
	d)	MoveRight.m
	e)	MoveUp.m
	f)	MoveDownLeft.m
	g)	MoveDownRight.m
	h)	MoveUpRight.m
	i)	MoveUpLeft.m
	j)	HalfPlane.m
	k)	IDPoint


i.	Open MATLAB

ii.	Open the folder of ‘A-Star on Project-2’ and run the code named MainCode.m. 

iii.	When the MainCode.m script is executed, it will ask to Input the Start and Goal Points co-ordinates.

iv.	Once the program starts executing, it plots the A* in the workspace of Project-2, i.e. the optimal path from the Start to End Point.
